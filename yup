uhhh yeah so go to any limited, in this example im using valkyrie (https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1365767/Valkyrie-Helm)
hit inspect element (ctrl shift i)
Hit the lil cursor and hover over the image of the accessory
then scroll a lil bit till you see a part of the code that starts with "<div id="ItemPurchaseAjaxData""
should be a white textbox at the bottom left of your screen saying div#ItemPurchaseAjaxData
edit that whole box and find the variable named "data-imageur" and copy the value, it should be something like https://tr.rbxcdn.com/e5fbbc38a10bad17163de8c456dd818b/110/110/Hat/Png
(in trade, for this case, it's 150/150 not 110)
